# DayPlanner
A daily planner
This was created for the purpose of fulfilling the challenge requirements in module 5. We were to take the starter code (HTML/CSS) and update both as well as build out the javascript to make the page function to meet the below requirements.

# Description 

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
